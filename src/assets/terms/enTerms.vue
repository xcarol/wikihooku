      This legal notice sets out the terms of use for the WikiHooku website (hereinafter "the
      website") operated by WikiHooku Team (hereinafter "we", "our" or "the entity"). By accessing

    <v-card-text>
      WikiHooku is a personal project in continuous development. This is the reason for no economic
      contribution request, and there are no ads either. In the same sense, the external services
      used for the operation of WikiHooku, despite being professional, are used with development
      accounts, which implies a limited use of resources, as well as the disclaimer of liability,
      both on the part of WikiHooku and the external services, in case of data loss or malfunction.
